# How to Get Started in Cyber Security

## TLDR - (Too Long, Didn't Read):
* Listen and Learn
* Create projects
* Get formal education and/or certificates

## A bit more detail
First, it's important to understand that there are numerous different fields in Computer Science and Cyber Security. When it comes to Cyber Security, perhaps some of the largest branches are:
* Network Security (Defense)
* Application Security (Defense)
* Vulnerability Researcher (Defense and Offense)
* Malware Analyst (Defense)
* Exploitation Analyst (Offense)
* Penetration Tester (Offense)
* CNO (Computer Network Operations) Developer (Offense)

There are many more branches but these stick out to me at the moment of writing this.

## How to get started 
While my path to cyber security isn't necessarily 'normal', it might be instructive.
Growing up in the 80's, my dad was a COBOL programer and we had a computer. We didn't have any game consoles so I had to play things on the computer in the time before Windows. During High school, my family built and sold custom computers. I worked at a dial-up internet service provider my senior year as tech support, and later got a job at Dell as tech support. After a few years, I left and worked at a Dot.Com where I cross-trained and did quality assurance work (where you do extensive, boring, and very important testing of the software). I later went to Iraq with the Marine Corps as an infantryman, and became a cop for 15 years. During that time, I attended several DEFCONs, a BlackHat, I built multiple home labs, listened to cyber security and hacker podcasts, learned Python, and generally continued being a nerd. Being a cop was my day job but computers were my passion. I later joined the Air Force Reserve as a 1B4x1 (Cyber Operator) and got formal training on Cyber Operations along with a TS (Top Secret clearance). All that training in the military earned me an Associate degree and I started my Bachelor's at Arizona. In 2021, I left the police department and became a full time Cyber Operator with my current company. At my company, we have a lot of cross-training opportunities and I get to learn from people in various fields of computer science and cyber security.

'OK, that's nice but what about me?' you're probably asking.
Remember the TLDR? I listened and learned. I created projects. I got formal education (military) and certificates (also military). When the time came where I was looking for a change, I was already ready to go. You can take the long route like I did or you can jump right into it. 

1) Start watching hacking / security YouTube channels, and listen to cyber security / hacking podcasts. Get into the world and the mindset. Attend DEFCON (every August) in Vegas if you can, and watch a lot of the past speakers on YouTube. Check out Wild West Hacking Fest and other CONs as well. Most post their speakers on YouTube after the conference.
 
2) Start working on a Computer Science degree if you can and try to learn as much as you can. Ask lots of questions, take it seriously, and don't just 'try to get through it'. With many jobs, as long as you are working on the degree, that counts the same as having one. You can also get certifications that might help out like Security+ which is typically the entry level requirement for a lot of government jobs and contracts.

3) Start some projects, start small. Learn how to use git and make some stuff. It's OK if it's terrible. Learn something new and make a small project out of it. Eventually, start making more projects that explore cooler things. Challenge yourself.

Honestly, if you challenge yourself, you can have an entry level job within a year.

## Some things to do to get started today:
Do this, seriously: https://www.nand2tetris.org/
It assumes you know nothing and teaches you from electricity up, how to make a game. It gives you a better understanding of a computer than mot other things and it's free.
